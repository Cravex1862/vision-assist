          <p className="p">Vision Assist started with a simple idea: make the world more accessible for people who are blind or have low vision through the power of connection.</p>
          <p className="p">The idea came from seeing how often people needed just a little visual assistance for everyday tasks. What if people who are blind or have low vision could connect with a global network of volunteers ready to lend their sight?</p>
          <p className="p">Today, millions of volunteers support users in many languages — proving that a little help goes a long way.</p>
